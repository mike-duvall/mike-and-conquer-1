# mike-and-conquer

My attempt at building a clone of the Original 1995 Command and Conquer

##To run, do:

* ./gradlew run

(You will need to have Java 8 installed.  Also, I'm currently developing in Linux and only testing in Linux)

##Current status
Not much working yet....
Currently just displaying a single minigunner in Nod colors


##Next milestone
* Clean up existing code
* Display GDI and Nod minigunners
* Add ability to select and move GDI minigunner
