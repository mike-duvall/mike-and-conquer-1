Here's something to get started. And I don't mean just on the colours.

The colors.ini file is my own design; colours don't actually get handled as colour scheme objects like that in the game (or, didn't, before my patch).
Nonetheless, the remapping values in there are the game's originals. I did add a few, mind you; the last ones, starting from DarkGrayPalette, were added by me,
and not originally in the game.

As for how this is applied, that's simple. To perform a remap the game needs a remapping table of 256 bytes.
For every graphic drawn on screen, it goes over the image data pixel by pixel and replaces each value (being, a palette offset) by the
 remapped palette offset found at the index of that pixel's value on the table. This system is also used for special colour effects in the game,
 like shroud edges, movement and targeting flashes, shadow and stealth darkening, etc(http://cnc-comm.com/community/index.php?topic=3048.0),
 but for the house remap case, only the range at C0-CF is changed, simply by having a table where each spot in the table has its own index as value,
 except for that C0-CF range.

Additional note: "Nod" is a name, not an acronym. So it's "Nod", not "NOD" :engie:



*******************

If you're planning to use these aforementioned other filters the game has (the .mrf fading tables), this might be handy, too:

It helps to understand how stuff like the shroud edge and movement targeting flash SHP files
(and, heck, the green colour for the unit shadow) are handled by the game.
(Though it might be easier to apply the effects themselves from code instead of from these tables, like RA1 does)
