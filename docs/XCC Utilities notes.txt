To explore and play around with the Command and Conquer MIX files:

Run the XCC Mixer program
Open conquer.mix

It will have the e1.shp file


XCC has a right click, then "Copy as PNG" feature to render the shp file as a series of PNGs.
THis may be good enough for things like mouse.shp, but for minigunner, it's not good enough,
because we need to render the minigunner in Nod colors too.
